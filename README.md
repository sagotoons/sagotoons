# about me

Hi there!

I'm Sacha Goedegebure, showrunner, director, writer and blender enthusiast. 
My career in 3d animation started as the writer and director of Big Buck Bunny, the first open movie created in the Blender Institute in Amsterdam.

For the last years, I've been creating tools/add-ons for a personal 1-person pipeline in blender, and I'd like to share some of these tools with you.

For contact, please find me at:

If you enjoy my tools, please consider supporting me on PayPal:

Cheers and happy blending!

Sacha
