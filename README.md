Hi there!

I'm Sacha Goedegebure, blender enthusiast and showrunner, director and writer at Omens Studios in Singapore. 
My career in 3d animation started as the writer and director of Big Buck Bunny, the first open movie created in the Blender Institute in Amsterdam.

Currently, my interest is in creating tools for a personal 1-person pipeline in blender, and I love to share what I managed to cook up.

For contact, please find me at:

Cheers!

Sacha
