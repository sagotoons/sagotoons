# about me

Hi there!

I'm Sacha Goedegebure, showrunner, director, writer and blender enthusiast. 
My career in 3d animation started as the writer and director of Big Buck Bunny, the first open movie created in the Blender Institute in Amsterdam.

Since start of 2020, I've picked up python with the sole purpose of creating tools (add-ons) for a personal project in Blender. The aim was to create an efficient 1-person pipeline. After years of development, I'd love to share some of my tools with you.

For contact, please find me at:

sagotoons@gmail.com

If you enjoy my tools, please consider supporting me on PayPal:

Cheers and happy blending!

Sacha
